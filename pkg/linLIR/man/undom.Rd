\title{
Finding undominated parameters
}
\description{
Functions within the \code{s.linlir}-function that determine the parameter combinations corresponding to undominated regression lines. The \code{undom.a}-function finds the set of undominated intercept values associated with a given slope and the \code{undom.para}-function finds the set of undominated intercept values associated with all slope values in a given range.
}
\usage{
undom.a(dat, b, q.lrm, p = 0.5, bet, epsilon = 0)

undom.para(dat, b.range, b.extra = 0, b.grid = 1000, q.lrm, p = 0.5, bet, epsilon = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dat}{
An \code{n}x4 \code{data.frame} containing the imprecise data of the analyzed variables. Columns 1 and 2 correspond to the interval-valued observations of the regressor variable, columns 3 and 4 to those of the dependent variable.
}
  \item{b}{
A given value for the slope of a regression line.
}
  \item{q.lrm}{
Value of the p-quantile of the absolute residuals associated with the LRM line(s).
}
  \item{p}{
Quantile of the abolute residuals' distribution to be used as loss function in the LIR analysis. (0.5 corresponds to the median.)
}
  \item{bet}{
Cutoff-point for the normalized profile likelihood function.
}
  \item{epsilon}{
Fraction of errors considered.
}
  \item{b.range}{
Considered interval of slope values.
}
  \item{b.extra}{
If it is likely that the set of undominated regression parameters is unbounded, one can consider very small or large values in addition to the \code{b.range}.
}
  \item{b.grid}{
1/\code{b.grid} is the width between two points of the considered grid of slope values within \code{b.range}.
}
}
\value{
The \code{undom.a}-function returns a list of 2 components:
\item{result1}{A 2-column matrix of possibly degenerate intervals for the undominated intercept values associated with the given slope b.}
\item{result2}{The information of \code{result1} reduced to the fewest intervals possible.}

The \code{undom.para}-function returns a list of 3 components:
\item{a.undom}{Range of intercept values of the undominated regression lines.}
\item{b.undom}{Range of slope values of the undominated regression lines.}
\item{undom.para}{A matrix of undominated parameter combinations approximating the entire set of parameters corresponding to the set of undominated regression lines.}
