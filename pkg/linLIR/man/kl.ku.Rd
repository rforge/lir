\title{
Finding \code{k.l} and \code{k.u}
}
\description{
Internal function to determine the quantities \code{k.l} and \code{k.u} on the basis of \code{n}, \code{p}, \code{bet}. This function is used within the

\usage{
kl.ku(n, p = 0.5, bet, epsilon = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{Number of observations.
}
  \item{p}{
Quantile of the abolute residuals' distribution to be used as loss function in the LIR analysis. (0.5 corresponds to the median.)
}
  \item{bet}{
Cutoff-point for the normalized profile likelihood function.
}
  \item{epsilon}{
Fraction of errors considered.
}
}
\value{
A vector with 2 elements, \code{k.l} and \code{k.u}.
