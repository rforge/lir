\title{
Finding Likelihood-based Region Minimax (LRM) line(s)
}
\description{
Function within the \code{s.linlir}-function that determines the Likelihood-based Region Minimax (LRM) line(s).
}
\usage{
gen.lms(dat, p = 0.5, bet, epsilon = 0, k.u = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dat}{
An \code{n}x4 \code{data.frame} containing the imprecise data of the analyzed variables. Columns 1 and 2 correspond to the interval-valued observations of the regressor variable, columns 3 and 4 to those of the dependent variable.
}
  \item{p}{
Quantile of the abolute residuals' distribution to be used as loss function in the LIR analysis. (0.5 corresponds to the median.)
}
  \item{bet}{
Cutoff-point for the normalized profile likelihood function.
}
  \item{epsilon}{
Fraction of errors considered.
}
  \item{k.u}{
As default \code{k.u} is calculated on the basis of \code{p}, \code{bet} and \code{epsilon}.
}
}
\details{
The exact algorithm implemented by the function gem.lms can be seen as a generalization of the basic algorithm for Least Median of Squares Regression (see, e.g., Steele / Steiger (1986) and Rousseeuw / Leroy (1987)). 
}
\value{
A list of two components.
\item{lrm}{A vector (or a matrix) of the intercept and slope parameter values of the LRM line(s) and the value of the p-quantile of the absolute residuals associated with the LRM line(s).}
\item{max.b}{The maximal absolute value of the considered slopes for the LRM line(s).}
